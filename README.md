# Contact Form

## This Python project is a web application built using Flask framework, HTML, CSS, and many more modules. Demo: <a href='http://slkat.pythonanywhere.com/' target='blank'>Contact Form Website</a>


## I've made this project because of my desire of wanting to learn HTML/CSS and FLask. I tied everything together and came up with this contact form. Here are some key features this web page can do.

<hr>

* Users can submit their info and a message through a contact form.
* Information is stored in a database using SQLAlchemy and also sends the recipient  an email of the message.
* An organized web structure of the contact form along with a formatted table of user's info, messages, and time created using HTML/CSS.
* Log-in function for admin authentication

## Set Up

<hr>

* Setup your email mail server/username/password in config.py. 
* Next add a password for admin authentication, default is username: 'admin', password: 'password'. 
* Lastly create table for database in terminal.
